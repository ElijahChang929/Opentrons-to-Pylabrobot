Pausing robot operation: 
    Take out PIXUL plate, fill empty wells of each started column
    with SDS buffer, seal plate and perform PIXUL sonication.
    After sonication, wash bottom of the plate, centrifuge and transfer
    supernatant to new plate using a multichannel pipette offline.

    Place new plate containing supernatant on slot 8.
    Remove empty epps from slot 1.
    Place 8 new eppendorfs in slot 1 in positions A1-B2.

Pausing robot operation: 

    Seal PCR tubes and store in -20°C freezer, leave one strip in slot 7
    (column 1, A1-H1) for current experiment. Remove eppendorf tubes
    from slot 1. Place a PP 96-well plate on slot 3 and a UV-star 96-well plate
    (for BCA measurement) on slot 5. Make sure the 96-well plate containing
    sample is on slot 8.
