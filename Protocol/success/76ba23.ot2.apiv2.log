Pausing robot operation: Paused for the following manual steps: (1)Seal the
    plates, then invert 10 times to mix, then on plate shaker 10 minutes. Spin.
    (2)Unseal the primary dna extraction plate and place it on the OT-2
    magnetic module (Slot 4). If a duplicate plate, unseal and place it back in
    its original deck slot. (3)Remove the premix reservoir from the OT-2 deck
    (Slot 3). Replace it with HKG DNA Wash Buffer 1 reservoir. (4)Remove the
    sample plate from the OT-2 deck (Slot 1). Replace it with a deep well plate
    containing water (in column 1) for the elution step. (5)Click resume in
    the OT app.
