Pausing robot operation: 
    Set up for part 2: Remove master mix plate and used tip boxes.
    Move sample plate to magnetic module. PCR plate (8.7 ul PCR master mix
    with indexes) on cycler, reagent reservoir in deck slot 1, p20 tips
    in slots 2, 3 and 5, p300 tips in slots 6 and 9.
    

    reagent reservoir in deck slot 1:
    col 1 - beads
    col 2 - 80% ethanol
    col 4 - water
    col 12 - waste
    

    sample plate on magnetic module:
    samples arranged in columns of 8
    up to 96 samples total
    96 samples in this run
    
Disengaging Magnetic Module

    PCR plate on cycler:
    containing 8.7 ul PCR master mix with indexes
    
Opening Thermocycler lid

    transfer beads to sample plate
    wait, engage magnet, wait

    liquid handling method for beads:
    slow flow rate for aspiration and dispense
    wait for liquid to finish moving after aspiration and dispense
    dispense to a surface
    withdraw tip slowly from liquid

    wash beads twice with 80 percent ethanol
    return tips for reuse with 2nd wash

    liquid handling method for ethanol:
    fast flow rate for blow out
    pre-wet the tips twice (saturate air)
    15 ul air gap
    dispense from top
    no tip touch (tip reuse)
    delayed blowout after dispense (let etoh fall to bottom of tip first)
    repeat blowout (for complete dispense)
