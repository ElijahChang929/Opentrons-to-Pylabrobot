Seal and shake at 1600 rpm for 1 minute. If liquid is visible on the seal, centrifuge at 500 x g for 1 minute. Inspect to make sure beads are resuspended. To resuspend, set your pipette to 35 µl with the plunger down, and then slowly pipette to mix. Place on the preprogrammed thermal cycler and run the COVIDSeq TAG PCR program
