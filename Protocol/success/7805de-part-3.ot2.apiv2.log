Delaying for 0 minutes and 10.0 seconds
Pausing robot operation: 
        pausing for off-deck steps

        first, spin the plate
        then, on thermocycler-

        30 min 20 C
        30 min 65 C
        hold 4 C

        immediately place plate in pre-chilled aluminum block
        and return to deck slot 7 for adapter ligation
        resume
        

    adapter ligation:
    add diluted adapter
    add ligation enhancer
    add ligation master mix
    mix thoroughly

    liquid handling method for master mix:
    slow flow rate for aspiration and dispense
    wait for liquid to finish moving after aspiration and dispense
    withdraw tip slowly from liquid
