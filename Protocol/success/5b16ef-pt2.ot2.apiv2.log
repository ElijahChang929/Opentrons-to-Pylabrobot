    Using a thermal cycler with lid heated to 100C, incubate plate at 55C
    for 15 minutes, followed by 10C hold (step 11 of section 8.4.2 of protocol)
    Program "Flex Tag" on the thermal cycler. Afterwards, place plate back on
    slot 4 of the deck and select "Resume" on the Opentrons app for
    Post Tagmentation Cleanup. Empty trash if needed.

Pausing robot operation: 
    Seal plate with Microseal A.
    Using a thermal cycler with lid heated to 100C, incubate plate at 37C
    for 15 minutes, followed by 10C hold (step 5 of section 8.4.3 of protocol)
    Program "Flex Post" on the thermal cycler. Afterwards, spin the plate,
    and place plate back on MAGNETIC MODULE and select "Resume" on the
    Opentrons app for washing. Empty trash if needed.
