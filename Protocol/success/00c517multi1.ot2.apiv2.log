    Place the following labware on the deck: 3D-print tuberack containing
    a PCR strip with TCEP/CAA on slot 1,
    sample plate (Agilent with square wells, 1400 µl) containing 50 µl sample
    on slot 2, S-trap plate on slot 3, 12-well reservoir on slot 4,
    20 µl tip rack on slot 5 and 300 µl tiprack on slot 6.
    Make sure the heater-shaker is on slot 10.

Pausing robot operation: 
    Check that all protease solution is at the bottom of the S-trap columns.
    If not, tap the S-trap plate until all solution is
    covering the S-trap material.
    Incubate S-trap plate with cover
    (do not seal tightly!) in incubator at 37°C overnight.
    Do not shake!
    Store leftover trypsin solution at -20°C. After digestion, perform elution
    with the TECAN Resolvex A200 or centrifuge.
    Dry eluted peptides (in 96-well plate) with a vaccuum concentrator.
