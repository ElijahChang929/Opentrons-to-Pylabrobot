Prepare and prime a 96.96 Dynamic ArrayTM Integrated Fluidic Circuit (IFC) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,inject one control line fluid syringe into each accumulator on the chip, and then prime the chip on the IFC Controller for approximately 20 minutes.










Thaw the Primer Plate, vortex and spin briefly.





Pausing robot operation: 




P20 multi transfer will begin at column 1 of tiprack on slot 6.
